# DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) Calculation Documentation

## Overview

Blipyy uses a **traditional DCF model** that projects cash flows year-by-year and includes terminal value. This is the proper DCF method, not a simplified target price calculation.

## Discount Rate

### How Discount Rate is Determined

#### 1. Calculated Using CAPM (Default)

The discount rate is **automatically calculated** using the Capital Asset Pricing Model:

```
Cost of Equity = Risk-free Rate + Beta x Market Risk Premium
```

**Components:**
- **Risk-free Rate**: 4% (10-year Treasury rate - hardcoded)
- **Beta**: Retrieved from Finnhub metrics (defaults to 1.0 if not available)
- **Market Risk Premium**: 6% (typical long-term average - hardcoded)

**Example:**
- If Beta = 1.2, Risk-free = 4%, MRP = 6%
- Discount Rate = 4% + (1.2 x 6%) = 4% + 7.2% = **11.2%**

#### 2. User Override (Optional)

Users can enter their own "Desired Annual Return" in the frontend, which **overrides** the calculated rate.

**Important:**
- User values are used **as entered** - no auto-correction
- Frontend converts percentage to decimal (e.g., 15% -> 0.15)
- Higher discount rate = lower fair value (more conservative)

#### 3. Scenario Defaults (If User Doesn't Enter)

If user doesn't provide discount rates, defaults are calculated:
- **Bear**: Base rate + 3% (more conservative)
- **Base**: Calculated CAPM rate
- **Bull**: Base rate - 2% (less conservative, minimum 5%)

### Discount Rate Impact

**Higher discount rate = Lower fair value**

Example with $100B terminal value, 10 years:
- 10% discount: PV = $38.55
- 15% discount: PV = $24.72 (36% lower)
- 20% discount: PV = $16.15 (58% lower)
- 50% discount: PV = $1.70 (96% lower)

The discount rate has a **massive impact** on fair value, especially on the terminal value component.

## Method 1: FCF-Based DCF (Primary Method)

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Project FCF for each year (1 to N)**
   ```
   For year t from 1 to N:
     If FCF margin is provided:
       Revenue_t = Revenue_{t-1} x (1 + growth_rate)
       FCF_t = Revenue_t x FCF_margin
     Else:
       FCF_t = FCF_{t-1} x (1 + growth_rate)
   ```

2. **Discount each year's FCF to present value**
   ```
   For year t:
     PV_t = FCF_t / (1 + discount_rate)^t
   ```

3. **Sum all present values**
   ```
   Sum of PVs = Sum(PV_t) for t = 1 to N
   ```

4. **Calculate Terminal Value**
   - **If P/FCF multiple provided:**
     ```
     Terminal Value = Final FCF x P/FCF_multiple
     ```
   - **If no multiple (uses Gordon Growth Model):**
     ```
     Terminal Value = (Final FCF x (1 + terminal_growth)) / (discount_rate - terminal_growth)
     ```
     Where `terminal_growth` = 3% (long-term GDP growth)

5. **Discount Terminal Value to Present**
   ```
   Terminal PV = Terminal Value / (1 + discount_rate)^N
   ```

6. **Calculate Total Intrinsic Value**
   ```
   Total Intrinsic Value = Sum of PVs + Terminal PV
   ```

7. **Calculate Fair Value Per Share**
   ```
   Fair Value = Total Intrinsic Value / Shares Outstanding
   ```

### Complete Formula:
```
Fair Value = [Sum(FCF_t / (1 + r)^t) + Terminal Value / (1 + r)^N] / Shares
```

Where:
- `FCF_t` = Free cash flow in year t
- `r` = Discount rate (user's desired annual return)
- `N` = Number of projection years (default: 10)
- `t` = Year (1, 2, 3, ..., N)

## Method 2: Earnings-Based DCF (Secondary Method)

Uses the same approach but with **Net Income** instead of FCF:

1. **Project Earnings for each year**
   ```
   For year t from 1 to N:
     If profit margin is provided:
       Revenue_t = Revenue_{t-1} x (1 + growth_rate)
       Earnings_t = Revenue_t x profit_margin
     Else:
       Earnings_t = Earnings_{t-1} x (1 + growth_rate)
   ```

2. **Discount each year's earnings**
   ```
   PV_t = Earnings_t / (1 + discount_rate)^t
   ```

3. **Calculate Terminal Value using P/E multiple**
   ```
   Terminal Value = Final Earnings x P/E_multiple
   Terminal PV = Terminal Value / (1 + discount_rate)^N
   ```

4. **Calculate Fair Value**
   ```
   Fair Value = [Sum(PV_t) + Terminal PV] / Shares Outstanding
   ```

---

## Final Result

```
Fair Value = Average of Method 1 and Method 2 (if both are valid)
```

If only one method produces valid results, that method's value is used.

## Example Calculation (MSFT Bull Scenario)

**Inputs:**
- Current FCF: $100,000,000,000
- Shares Outstanding: 15,000,000,000
- Growth Rate: 8% (0.08)
- P/FCF Multiple: 30
- Discount Rate: 10% (0.10)
- Years: 10

**Year-by-Year Projection:**

| Year | FCF | Discount Factor | Present Value |
|------|-----|----------------|---------------|
| 1 | $108.00B | 1.10 | $98.18B |
| 2 | $116.64B | 1.21 | $96.40B |
| 3 | $125.97B | 1.33 | $94.71B |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 10 | $215.89B | 2.59 | $83.36B |

**Sum of PVs (Years 1-10):** $820.31B

**Terminal Value:**
- Final FCF: $215.89B
- Terminal Value = $215.89B x 30 = $6,476.70B
- Terminal PV = $6,476.70B / 2.59 = $2,497.57B

**Total Intrinsic Value:**
- Total = $820.31B + $2,497.57B = $3,317.88B
- Fair Value = $3,317.88B / 15B shares = **$221.19 per share**

## Key Features

1. **Projects cash flows year-by-year** - accounts for time value of money each year
2. **Includes terminal value** - accounts for value beyond projection period
3. **Uses exit multiples** - P/E and P/FCF for terminal value
4. **Discounts everything to present** - proper DCF methodology
5. **Averages multiple methods** - FCF and Earnings-based for robustness

## Why Discount Rate Matters

1. **Higher discount rate = Lower fair value**
   - If you require 15% return vs 10%, you need to pay less today
   - This is the fundamental principle of DCF

2. **Terminal value is most sensitive**
   - Terminal value is typically 60-70% of total value
   - Small changes in discount rate cause large changes in terminal PV

3. **Early years are less sensitive**
   - Year 1 cash flow discounted at 10% vs 15%: 9% vs 8.7% (small difference)
   - Year 10 terminal value: 38.5% vs 24.7% (large difference)

## Implementation Summary

- Calculates discount rate using CAPM (proper financial methodology)
- Allows user override (flexibility for different scenarios)
- No arbitrary limits (user can enter any discount rate)
- No auto-correction (user's values are respected)
- Properly applied (discounts all cash flows and terminal value)
- Profit margin and FCF margin assumptions directly affect projected earnings and FCF when entered
